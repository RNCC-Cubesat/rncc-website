        <p>
            Resilient Nuclear CubeSat Constellation (RNCC) is a network of cyber-secure communications infrastructure based on novel research and future-oriented security principles.  Early space assets were originally analog and today's digital infrastructure is fraught with cyber-criminals using low-cost equipment to attack space communications, sensors, navigation systems, and other operation-sensitive assets.
<br />
To meet the challenges of increasing security threats, RNCC will provide a cyber-secure communications infrastructure to collect, store, and transmit sensor data.  Using dual-processor CubeSats, orbiting in space, and novel radio frequency technology, we are able to support missions such as detecting atmospheric nuclear burst events.
<br />
RNCC's cyber-secure communications use widely dispersed, very high-velocity Doppler shifts to identify nefarious attempts to steal, hamper, degrade, intercept, disturb data, or processing elements.  The higher doppler shifts, associated with objects in low Earth orbits, improve data and operational security.
<br />
RNCC's security is baked into both the hardware and software architecture and uses the high velocities of low-earth-orbit to ensure cybersecurity.  Through the use of Doppler shift and precise geolocation of all ground-based processing nodes, requests for data can be filtered to remove unapproved requests.

                Abstract
            </em>

            <br /> CubeSats continue to proliferate and are an excellent low-cost method of remote sensing. A key piece of intelligent systems is sensory input, data storage, and data communications. With the continued miniaturization of technology, CubeSats
            will increase their sensory inputs with future miniaturization and enhance their robustness for autonomous operations if data and communications are secure. These futures inspire an intelligent system solution to on-orbit communications. This
            paper explores a dual-microprocessor approach to improve hardware cybersecurity of intelligent systems, with a view toward intensional intelligence as a means of adjudicating access to sensitive data onboard the CubeSat. With enhanced cybersecurity,
            Artificial Intelligent Systems (AIS) will add vital utility to otherwise vulnerable, autonomous systems. Using Systems Models-Based Thinking, we shed light on our plan to apply artificial intelligent system concepts to advance CubeSat technology.
            Managing technology for AIS reduces some of the uncertainties and risks associated with the space environment.

                Abstract
            </em>

            <br /> The ability to send low cost satellites into space has changed the satellite industry and vastly opened up the use of satellites to transform data into information for individuals, organizations, commercial companies, and governments.
            This information can be corroborated with other sources of data to evaluate the availability of precious resources, e.g., potable water, agriculture; to forecast upcoming famines or diseases; and to perform mapping, communications, and competitive
            analyses. The cost of owning a satellite is less than $100,000 (using commercial parts) to $1,000 (built by school kids). Launch costs are tens of thousands of dollars, which can be eliminated through subsidies. Compare these costs to $200
            million to $1 billion costs for similar functionality, higher performance and greater durabilityâ€”an interesting trade space that favors multiple low cost flights versus significantly higher costs for permanent satellites for an increasing
            number of applications. The challenge is to form and manage a development team of unskilled professionals, high school students, or university students to meet deadlines and flight-standards. These team members are likely highly motivated
            and unskilled. This paper describes the technical management strategy and techniques used to develop the 10 cm, 6-sided CubeSats.
