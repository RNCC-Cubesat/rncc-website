## About Us

Remote Nuclear CubeSat Consellation (RNCC) is primarily a cyber-secure communcation infastructure based on a system of created on novel research linked below. A growing need for satellites to increase security has emerged as greater risk of states, organizations, and individual actors desire to commandeer, co-opt, inhibit, or destroy on-orbit capabilities.

The origins of these problems as they relate to space assets are three-fold: first, technology used in space was originally analog and not digital. With the economic benefits, increased capability, and inherent adaptiveness of digital technology, the digital domain is fraught with cyber-criminals who can use low cost equipment to attack space communications, sensors, navigation, and operations.

The system will provide a cyber-secure communications infrastructure by which to collect, store, and transmit sensor data from low-cost detection of a simulated atmospheric nuclear burst event from Earth-orbit and provide high precision geolocation information of these events in conjunction with ground-based fix-point nodes. The dual processor CubeSat, orbiting in space, will have sensors, data storage, and radio communication to collect data and send it to the appropriate users.

RNCC's cybersecure communications rely on widely dispersed, very high-velocity Doppler shifts to identify nefarious attempts to steal, hamper, degrade, intercept, or disturb data or processing elements. Higher doppler shifts (associated with objects in low Earth orbits) dramatically improve data & operational security. RNCC uses the hardware & software architecture, in addition to the high relatively CubeSat velocity to static ground-nodes to ensure the highest level of cybersecurity. Cybersecure data results from moving the two-processor computers relative to each other using the CubeSat Doppler shift as the means to precisely determine the pathlength to each ground processing node expected positional location for all data entry and retrieval ports. Consequently, all ground-based processing nodes must be precisely geolocated.
